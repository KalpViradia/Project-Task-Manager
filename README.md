Here's a tailored `README.md` file for your **React-based Task Manager** project with authentication and MongoDB integration:

---

# 🗂️ Project Task Manager

A full-stack task management app built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. This app allows users to register, log in, and manage their personal task lists — including creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Each user sees only their own tasks.

---

## ✅ Features

* User authentication (register & login)
* Create new tasks
* Edit existing tasks
* Delete tasks
* View tasks specific to the logged-in user
* Tasks stored securely in MongoDB
* Responsive React UI

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React, Axios, React Router
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **Database**: MongoDB
* **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt

---

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm
* MongoDB running locally or remotely

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KalpViradia/Project-Task-Manager.git
   cd Project-Task-Manager
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the app**
   Open your browser at: `http://localhost:3000/`

## ⚙️ How It Works

* Users sign up or log in via the React frontend.
* JWT-based tokens are used to authenticate users on every request.
* Once logged in, users can create, update, and delete their own tasks.
* All task data is stored in MongoDB and scoped per user.
* The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls.
